<p style="font-size:20px">The programming language is an official language that includes a set of instructions that produce different types of outputs. Programming languages ​​are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.

Most programming languages ​​consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, instead of general programming languages. Before the invention of the digital computer, perhaps the first was the automatic flute that the Musa brothers described in Baghdad in the ninth century during the Islamic Golden Age.Since the early nineteenth century, programs have been used to direct the behavior of machines such as jacquard looms, music boxes, and operator pianos. Software of these devices (such as operator piano scripts) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or circumstances.
Thousands of different programming languages ​​have been created, and more are created every year. Many programming languages ​​are written inevitably (i.e., as a sequence of operations to be performed) while other languages ​​use the introductory model (i.e. the desired result is determined, not how to achieve it).</p>
